# A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members by evaluating their diets. As part of her evaluation,
# she asks members for the number of fat grams, carbohydrate grams, and protein grams that they consumed in
# a day. Then, she calculates the number of calories that result from the fat, using the following formula:

#           calories from fat = fat grams X 9

# Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from the carbohydrates, using the following formula:

#           calories from carbs = carb grams X 4

# Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from the proteins, using the following formula:

#           calories from protein = protein grams X 4

calories = 1
total = 1

calories from fat = fat_grams * 9
calories from carbs = carb_grams * 4
calories from protein = protein_grams * 4

fat = int(input('How many grams of fat did you eat today?'))
carbs = int(input('How many grams of carbs did you eat today?'))
protein = int(input('How many grams of protein did you eat today?'))

print('You ate', calories, 'calories from protein today.')
print('You ate a total of', total, 'calories today.')
